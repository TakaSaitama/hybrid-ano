# Hybrid-Ano  

Our approach utilizes a hybrid solution:  

- **Supervised Learning (Deep Forest)** whenever applicable.  
- **Unsupervised Learning** when supervision is not feasible:  
  - **Isolation Forest** for water level rise anomaly detection.  
  - **Diversity-Based Methods** for butterfly anomaly detection.
